1. project description:
somehow like a postman send the packages to the destinations or  amazon roboters
a epuck will follow the line in the map, detect the atificial road, city map with different blocks, 
the map have many crossroads 
the map will be given previously, 
e peck will find the optimal route to destination
we shall add some obtascles in the future.
  
2. model:
action: trun right, turn left, turn right, forward, backward(转的时候要掉头，不能直接向后转)
states: different crossroads 5-10 states
reward: when the epuck arrives at the destination, it will get 10 points, the another states are 0.  


3.how to judge which state epuck is:
solution 1: use the under sensor to scan the "光电黑白编码" on the road in oder to know which 'road' the Epuck is.

solution 2: use the front cmos camera to do some pattern recognition.
e.g. detect 'A', 'B', 'C'.......
or: dectect differnt colors
 

4. algorithm:
q learning
calculate the different states' Q-function


5. how to avoid obstacles:
differnt from the grid world scenary, epuck will go 'into' the obstacles, namely wrong states. so how to deal with these problems?
a question:
whether add new states for the new coming obstacles or 'blind alley'

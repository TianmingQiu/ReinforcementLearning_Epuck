This library provides an ePuck.py compatible interface to the V-REP
(http://www.v-rep.eu/) simulator. Thus, programs can run via bluetooth, on the
Overo extension or the V-REP simulator without much change.

This libray is written in Python 2.7 and needs the remoteApi.[so|dll|dylib] from
the V-REP simulator to run.

Currently motors, leds, ground- and proximity sensors should work.

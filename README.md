Based on the given sensors and the physical structures (especially the pohysical limits) we now have these ideas below:

1. trce a line
2. find a shortest way to the destination in a map with many 'crossroads'
3. get out of a simulated, vitual appartment in an optimical route, which with several rooms that have different colors or different textures is.
